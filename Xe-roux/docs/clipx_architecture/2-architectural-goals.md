# 2. Architectural Goals
- **Reliability:** provide stable downloads within free-tier constraints
- **Simplicity:** easy to deploy and maintain (Docker + minimal infra)
- **Cost-efficiency:** operate on zero/low-cost hosting (Vercel + Render/Railway)
- **Extensibility:** allow components to be swapped (e.g., move to paid infra) without major rewrites
- **Security & Legal Awareness:** avoid storing copyrighted content long-term, enforce rate limits, sanitize inputs
