# 8. Security, Abuse Prevention & Legal Considerations
## Security
- Validate and sanitize all incoming URLs (reject suspicious schemes or local addresses)
- Run `yt-dlp` in a sandboxed environment (Docker) to reduce risk
- Limit size of downloads and reject extremely large files
- Use HTTPS everywhere; set secure cookies and CSP headers
- Protect backend with rate-limiting and CAPTCHAs for suspicious behavior

## Abuse Prevention
- Rate-limit per IP and per API key (if implemented)
- Request throttling and job queue quotas
- Monitor for repeated requests to same target and apply temporary blocks

## Legal Considerations
- Provide clear Terms of Service and a copyright/disclaimer page describing user responsibility
- Do NOT offer built-in redistribution or hosting of copyrighted content; delete temporary files promptly
- Consider geofencing or legal counsel if you plan to expand into monetized operations
